We aim at significantly reducing slips and fall exposure with our chemical treatment and service.

Hi Mrs. Castro,

Wanted to follow-up on a voicemail I left you earlier; was hoping you and I could chat about how hospitals are reducing their slip and fall risks throughout their facilities by leveraging GripOn's non-slip flooring solutions. GripOn offers a chemical solution/service that increases the traction on hard mineral floors up to 5 times without changing the look or lifespan of the floor. See it in action here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z73V62-Uey0

Do you see merit in this as a potential solution for areas of concern at Nicklaus Children's Hospital? Would you be interested in the GripOn team conducting a lunch and learn demo with you and your team?

Best,

Hi Mike,

Figured an email would be a little easier on you than a voicemail. Purpose of my call earlier was to discuss how hospitals like Shriner's are leveraging GripOn's suite of non-slip flooring solutions and services to reduce slip and fall risks throughout their facilities. GripOn is a chemical treatment that increases the DCOF of hard mineral floors by up to 5 times without changing the look or lifespan of the floor.

Here's a video of how it works:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVsMNoNwEus

Do you see some merit here? Could get our Florida crew over to you to conduct a demo next week if you are interested?

Thanks,

Hi Gregg,

Sorry that I missed you. I spoke with Tricia, but wanted to follow up.

I'm reaching out to you on behalf of the GripOn team out of Florida.

I'm sure at times thefloors at the University of Florida become slippery, especially when wet. Slips and falls are an exposure that no one wants to have. 16% of Worker痴 Comp claims are due to slips, trips and falls.

I'd like to introduce a solution to this challenge. GripOn is aneco and environmentally friendly floor treatment that can increase the Dynamic Coefficient of Friction (traction) of hard floors up to 5 times (complying with the ANSI standard) without changing the look or lifespan of the floor.

Here is how it works:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z73V62-Uey0&authuser=0.


If interested in learning more, let me know and I can send you more info.

Hi Marcus,

Hope all is well. Left you a voicemail earlier and thought that an email might be a more convenient way of introducing GripOn to you.

GripOn is non-slip flooring solution that increases the dynamic coefficient of friction for hard mineral floors up to 5 times (even when wet) without changing the look or lifespan of the floor. We've seen it work well in clinical areas where slips and falls are more prevalent. Here's how it works:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z73V62-Uey0

Would you be interested in a free demonstration at LGMC to see if it might be able to help with any areas of concern you might have?

Hi Don,

Thought an email would be a little more convenient than the voicemail I left you earlier. Wanted to discuss with you how our clients are reducing slip and fall risks at their facilities by leveraging our suite of non-slip flooring solutions and services at GripOn. We are a safety company out of Lafayette, LA and we focus on making slippery hard surface floors non-slip using a proprietary, eco and environmentally safe chemical treatment - here's how it works:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVsMNoNwEus

Best part is that this solution does not change the look or lifespan of the floor! Would appreciate an opportunity to discuss it with you in hopes that you might be interested in having GripOn conduct a demo for you and your team at your location.

Best,

Hi Felix,

Was following up as per a voice message I left you regarding GripOn. GripOn is a chemical treatment that we provide that turns slippery hard mineral floors into non-slip floors. If there are any areas of concern over at the Jewish Community Center - we would be more than happy to come out and demonstrate how the product/service works for you guys. What are your thoughts?

Hi Ken,

Hope all is well. If slips and falls have been a concern throughout your facilities; GripOn may be able to help. GripOn USA is a safety company out of Lafayette that provides a non-slip flooring solution for hard mineral floors like tile and the like. The chemical treatment is safe, affordable and does not change the look or lifespan of your flooring; we also apply it for you so it's a turnkey solution. Here's how it works:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z73V62-Uey0

If this seems to have some merit; I'd love to discuss it with you and propose a live demo from the GripOn team experts. Is it OK if I follow-up with another call?

It was great speaking with you, thanks for your time.


I'm sure at times thefloors at Nicholls become slippery, especially when wet. Slips and falls are an exposure that no one wants to have. 16% of Worker痴 Comp claims are due to slips, trips and falls.

Purpose of my reaching out is to introduce a solution to this challenge. GripOn is aneco and environmentally friendly floor treatment that can increase the Dynamic Coefficient of Friction (traction) of hard floors up to 5 times (complying with the ANSI standard) without changing the look or lifespan of the floor.

Hi Ryan,

Left a message for you with Julie yesterday and had a short discussion with Jenna today about GripOn's chemical treatment service and how it can reduce the risks of slips and falls accidents on any of your potentially slippery floors at Kart Ranch. GripOn creates a micro-tread design on hard mineral floors that increases the traction on the floor up to 5 times, without changing the look and lifespan of your floor. Jenna said that Kart Ranch has tile floors in the lobby and bathrooms - here's a video of how it works:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z73V62-Uey0

The GripOn team applies the chemical for you as part of the solution so it's turnkey (they even do the work during off hours). Would be happy to set up a demo with you and the GripOn team to show you how they can treat that area and reduce slip and fall accidents. How's next week looki",1

We would like to come out to do a demo of our chemical solution for slippery floors. What we have seen with other school boards is that these schools have troubling areas with entrance ways, cafeterias, and bathrooms .

We are open from the 18th to the 22nd to come out to test the areas of concern you might have and demo our product to see if we can help reduce slip and fall accidents.

Let me know if a day next week works for you and your team.

Thanks for your time, I look forward to following up with you Monday.

I wanted to follow up and give you a little more insight on GripOn before your meeting tomorrow.

GripOn is meant for decreasing the likelihood of injuries at commercial work sites. Injuries on the work site may result in lawsuits and other detrimental consequences on a business. GripOn is a safety company that in addition to providing safety expertise, also carries a slip-prevention, low acidity solution that creates microscopic pores in the soft minerals of hard mineral floors which increases the dynamic coefficient of friction of a floor (fancy way of saying making it less slippery). GripOn is guaranteed to surpass ANSI痴 regulation of a dynamic coefficient of friction (DCOF) greater than .42 (ANSI 326.3). Unlike etching or matts; GripOn痴 solution does not degrade the look or life-span of yo",1

Hi Charlotte,

Thanks for speaking with me today. Like I said earlier, GripOn USA is a Louisiana-based safety company that provides facilities and facility directors with solutions to dangerous slippery hard mineral floors. Our core solution is a chemical treatment service for floors that increases the DCOF by up to 5 times without changing the look or lifespan of the floor. Here's a video of how it works:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z73V62-Uey0

Wanted to reach out and see if you might have any areas of concern and would like for us to come out and test the area with you and see how/if we have a solution that can reduce the slip and fall risks of that area. Most areas of concern we see are stair wells, entrances, lobbies, gazebos, etc.

We can be flexible these next two weeks. What works for you all?

Thanks,

Body:
Hi Brigitta,

I'm sure at times thefloors at John Hopkins become slippery, especially when wet. Slips and falls are an exposure that no one wants to have. 16% of Worker痴 Comp claims are due to slips, trips and falls.

Purpose of my reaching out is to introduce a solution to this challenge. GripOn is aneco and environmentally friendly floor treatment that can increase the Dynamic Coefficient of Friction (traction) of hard floors up to 5 times (complying with the ANSI standard) without changing the look or lifespan of the floor.

Here is how it works:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z73V62-Uey0&authuser=0.


If interested in learning more, let me know and I can send you more info.
Would it be OK if I followed up with a phone call later?

Hi Dean,

I'm sure at times thefloors at Tampa General become slippery, especially when wet. Slips and falls are an exposure that no one wants to have. 16% of Worker痴 Comp claims are due to slips, trips and falls.

Purpose of my reaching out is to introduce a solution to this challenge. GripOn is aneco and environmentally friendly floor treatment that can increase the Dynamic Coefficient of Friction (traction) of hard floors up to 5 times (complying with the ANSI standard) without changing the look or lifespan of the floor.

Here is how it works:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z73V62-Uey0&authuser=0.


If interested in learning more, let me know and I can send you more info.
Would it be OK if I followed up with a phone call later?

Hi Blaine,

Left a message with Shannon but thought I would shoot you a quick note. My name is Reece Theriot and I am reaching out on behalf of GripOn, a Lafayette-based safety company that specializes in slippery hard mineral floors in entrances, elevator landings, lobbies, gyms, etc. I wanted to see if you all have had any challenging areas regarding slips and falls and if so, we could come in and demo our non-slip chemical treatment on that area to show you if/how it works.

Our chemical treatment is a low acidity solution that increases the traction on the floor by up to five times without changing the appearance or life-span of the floor.

If you are interested, would you like our team to come in for a demo towards the end of February or sometime in March?

Thanks,

Hi Donell,

Thanks a bunch for taking the time to speak with me today regarding some of the areas in your hospital that pose a challenge regarding slips and fall risks. Ultimately, we aim at offering you solutions to this issue. Our primary solution is a chemical treatment for hard mineral floors that we apply to the floor. This treatment creates micro pores into the surface of the floor and increases the DCOF by up to 5 times without changing the appearance or life-span of the floor.

Hi Bryan,

Thanks for taking my call earlier and enjoyed the conversation. As I mentioned over the phone, GripOn provides a low acidity chemical treatment for hard mineral floors (like Terrazzo) that become slippery when wet. The treatment slightly breaks down the soft mineral bonds in the floor and produces micro tread-like designs on the floor which increases the Dynamic Coefficient of Friction on the floor by up to 5 times without changing the look or life-span of the floor. The GripOn team would be happy to come and demo the product to you on any areas of concerns that you may have - you mentioned some entrances.

How does November 29th and 30th look for a demo? Anytime during those two days work for our team.

Joe,

You and your team may be experiencing challenges with slippery floors at your facilities, especially at entrances and other areas that get slippery when wet. This increases the risks of slip and fall accidents which we aim at helping you eliminate by leveraging GripOn USA痴 services.

GripOn痴 core service is a chemical treatment service that makes hard mineral floors non-slip. It increases the Dynamic Coefficient of Friction (traction) of your floors up to 5 times without changing the look or lifespan of the floor.See GripOn in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z73V62-Uey0

Joe, may I follow up later this week, or next, to discuss our team doing a free demo on an area of concern that you and your team may have?

PS I received your email from a very nice lady in Engineering (didn't catch her name).

Thank you for the consideration,

Hi Bryan,

Was speaking with Tammie Prejean yesterday about how GripOn has been helping organizations reduce slip and fall risks with out chemical treatment that retroactively makes hard mineral floors that are slipper - non-slip by creating a microtread-like design on the floor without changing the look and lifespan.

She seemed interested but said that I should send you and email. Wanted to reach out and see if you would be OK with me following-up with a phone call soon to discuss any areas of concern you might have at Our Lady of Lourdes.

Hi Andrew,

Was great speaking with you yesterday. Just wanted to follow up and provide you with a little more information regarding GripOn's suite of solutions / services for slippery hard mineral floors. The core solution/service is a low-acidity solution that is applied to slippery hard mineral floors and increases the DCOF by up to 5 times without changing the look or life-span of the floor.

We would appreciate an opportunity to test (with our tribometer) the DCOF of any areas of concerns you may have and then demonstrate our solution on said areas to show you how it works. We can also provide a competitive quote for services on said area and other areas that you may have. Here's a video of how it works:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z73V62-Uey0
